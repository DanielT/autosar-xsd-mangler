# autosar-xsd-mangler

This tool reads autosar .xsd files and generates the specification tables used in [autosar-data-specification](https://github.com/DanielT/autosar-data/tree/main/autosar-data-specification/src).

The required xsd files are not provided here, since their copyright does not allow for redistribution.
